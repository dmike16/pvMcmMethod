 *  This my thesis's project, about a method to approximate                 *
 *  the equation of surface evolution by meam curvature flow in R^3 space.  *
 *  At the end of the execution of this program we'll have an octave script *
 *  in order to plot the solution.                                          *
 *  Usage:                                                                  *
 *   pvschema.out <file_initial_values>.dat (<filename_apprx_solu>.dat)     *
 *  The <file_initial_values>.dat must contain only the initial values in   *
 *  numerical form, in this order :                                         *
 *   .OutPutTime                                                            *
 *   .DimSpace (that must be 3 to use the func in pvmcm directory           *
